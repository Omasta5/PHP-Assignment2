                <p>The only thing I listed that ISN'T from a game, Sgt Frog is on of the few anime I'm into, idk it's just a dumb fun show about frog-like aliens who try (and fail) to conquer earth!</p>

                <p>OOOO I love this game!! A WarioLand inspired indie game made recently last 2024. It's super fast past and I highly reccomend it!</p>

                <p>An amazing rythem game made back in 2018, if you need a good hype up game, this is an awesome one to go to! (Don't play this if you can't handle flashing colours tho)</p>

                <p>Made back in 2022, I've been a fan of this game since they revealed it back in late 2020! It perfectly summerizes my tastes in style: cute n' creepy!</p>
